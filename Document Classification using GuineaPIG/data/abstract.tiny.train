Alex_Gillon	Person	alexander george alex or alec gillon 23 december 1909 ca 2007 was a civic and sporting administrator in melbourne australia he was most notable as the longestserving president of the victorian football association and as a mayor of the city of brunswickgillon was born in broadmeadows in northwestern melbourne he played australian rules football when he was young and at his peak played 88 games for the brunswick football club in the victorian football association vfa during the 1930s where he was part of brunswicks 1938 premiership team he was cleared to coburg in may 1939 and played there for one seasonafter world war ii gillon took a position on the brunswick football club committee he served as a club delegate on the vfa board of management from 1949 until 1953 then in february 1954 he successfully challenged lewis page for presidency of the vfa when gillon took on the presidency the vfa was in decline and struggling badly compared with the strong position it had enjoyed during the 1940s crowds were declining due to the abandoning of the popular throw pass rule in 1950 various social and demographic changes in postwar melbourne were reducing crowds and revenues and the association board was suffering from factional fighting as a result of the fallout from the changes gillon soon provided strong leadership which largely reunified the associations board and the association began to recover from a situation which threatened its viabilityone of the first challenges gillon faced during his presidency was grounds control as there were several bids by other football codes during the 1950s and then by victorian football league vfl clubs during the 1960s to take over the tenancy of vfa grounds gillon refused to compromise on the vfas requirement that clubs had sole winter use of their grounds which cost prahran temporarily and moorabbin permanently their places in the association but it set a strong example that the vfa was prepared to defend itself against stronger opponents a trait which gillon carried throughout his presidency gillon then oversaw the introduction of sunday football in 1960 the early 1960s expansion of the association into the outer suburbs to overcome postwar demographic shifts in the inner suburbs and the partitioning of the vfa into two divisions in 1961 and after the vfa secured weekly television coverage from 1967 the vfa enjoyed one of its most successful periods ever during the 1970s also under gillons presidency however the vfas relationship with the vfl soured culminating in the vfas expulsion in 1970 from the australian national football council of which gillon had served as vicepresident during the late 1960s and a lingering adversarial relationship between the competitions which lasted until the 1980s when asked about his relationship with the vfl on television during the 1970s gillon replied i dont hate the vfl im just provfagillon went on to become the vfas longestserving president serving unopposed for 27 seasons from 1954 until 1980 and exceeding the 25year tenure of j g aikman 19031928 in 1981 with the vfas success of the 1970s beginning to wane and many clubs believing a new direction was required gillon was challenged for the presidency and defeated by alan wickes five years later gillon returned as part of the football organisation review team fort which was formed in 1986 by wickes successor brook andersen to develop a new strategy for the vfa in a changing victorian football market the forts controversial report which sought to rationalise the vfa to 12 teams was rejected by the clubs but was instrumental in shaping the natural contraction of the vfa in the late 1980soutside football gillon served a long career in local government in 1954 he was elected to the council of the city of brunswick he was a justice of the peace and a onetime vicechairman of the board of works before serving as the mayor of brunswick gillons effectiveness as a civic administrator

the brunswick football club and the brunswick council the brunswick football ground was renamed the a g gillon oval in his honour in early 1976 the annual award for the best and fairest player in the

Icesave_dispute	other	the icesave dispute was a diplomatic dispute that began after the privately owned icelandic bank landsbanki went bankrupt on 7 october 2008 with a subsequent dispute evolving between iceland on one hand and the united kingdom and the netherlands on the other as the bankruptcy of landsbanki was one of three big systemically important financial institutions going bankrupt within a few days in iceland the icelandic depositors and investors guarantee fund tryggingarsjur had already been drained of capital reserves this resulted in no funds to repay the legally required deposit guarantees to the foreign landsbanki customers who had lost all their savings in the icesave branch of the bank the icelandic state refused to underwrite this liability on behalf of the guarantee fund originally this was because the state had lost funding access at credit markets due to the icelandic financial crisis but later proposed bilateral loan guarantees for repayment were rejected by the icelandic electoratethe dispute was centered on the demand by the british and dutch states that the icelandic state should guarantee at least the repayment of the icelandic minimum deposit guarantees up to 20887 per account holder which would be equal to 235bn 27bn repaid to uk and 13bn repaid to the netherlands routed partlyentirely through the liquidation of remaining positive assets by the landsbanki receivership when landsbanki went bankrupt and was placed into receivership by the icelandic financial supervisory authority fme all 343306 retail depositors in uk and netherlands with an account in the icesave branch of landsbanki lost their total 67bn of savings because no immediate repayment was expected by any icelandic institutionsauthorities the dutch and british states covered these account losses in full this meant that their national deposit guarantee schemes covered repayment up to the maximum limit for the national deposit guarantees  and the states covered the restthe icesave dispute was centered on the fact that iceland had passed a law on 6 october 2008  the day before the landsbanki bankruptcy  that guaranteed full coverage of lost deposits for domestic icelandic customers in the event of any icelandic banks bankruptcy at the same time there was no guarantee for foreign customers of the same bank with this law in hand the landsbanki receivership was obliged to split up the old landsbanki on 9 october 2008 so that all domestic assets and liabilities were transferred and to be continued by a newly founded domestic version of the bank named ni landsbanki  entirely owned by the icelandic state while the new bank was fully solvent the remaining foreign branch of the bankrupt landsbanki was left with isk 1743 billion 121bn in assets to face up its isk 3197 billion of liabilities 222bn the public controversy got more heated when the uk parliament on 8 october used its antiterrorism legislation against iceland in order to attempt freezing all icelandic bank assets in the uk until the time where a mutual repayment agreement for the icelandic minimum deposit guarantees had been enactedthe uk and netherlands only required for the icelandic state to guarantee repayment of the icelandic minimum deposit guarantees 40bn to retail depositors and did not require any repayment guarantee for the other 182bn creditor claims in the bankrupt landsbanki the icelandic state was offered a 235bn 27bn repayment loan by uk and a 13bn repayment loan by the netherlands where the landsbanki receivership should repay with all the funds they could from the liquidation of assets in 20092015 and where the icelandic state starting from 2016 subsequently should overtake the liability for the remaining repayments including accrued interests to uk and netherlands the icesave bill 1 was the first negotiated loan agreement attempting to define the repayment terms for these two loans it was passed by the icelandic parliament and enacted by the president on 2 september 2009 but was not accepted by the governments of uk and netherlands due to a unilaterally attached term added by the icelandic parliament which limited icelands repayment guarantee only to 2024 with automatic cancellation of any potential owing still existing beyond this year instead uk and netherlands then counter proposed a new version of the loan agreement referred to as icesave bill 2 where no time limit was included for the icelandic states repayment guarantee this was at first accepted by the icelandic parliament but the icelandic president refused to enact the law and referred any approval decision to a referendum being held on 6 march 2010 where it was subsequently rejectedafter the rejection of icesave bill 2 some renewed negotiations immediately started about the adjustment of the terms for the repayment agreement which was considered to be the root cause why the icelandic people had rejected it in 2010 the negotiations resulted in december 2010 in an adjusted version of the repayment agreement named icesave bill 3 with better terms for iceland the improved terms included the removal of a previous creditor priority issue and the introduction of a lower 3 interest rate in combination with interest moratorium for the first year until 1 october 2009 if needed when the icelandic state overtake repayment liabilities from the receivership in 2016  then also a possible extension of the repayment window up to 30 years when the icesave bill 3 subsequently was put to a referendum in april 2011 it was again rejected by 59 of icelandic voters after analysing the election result it was decided by all stakeholders not to attempt negotiation for a further improved icesave bill 4 but instead to refer the case as a legal infringement dispute for the efta court to judgeon 28 january 2013 the efta court cleared iceland of all charges meaning that iceland was freed from the disputed obligation to sign a loan guarantee agreement for repayment of icelandic minimum deposit guarantees worth 40bn isk 674bn plus accrued interest to uk and the netherlands this repayment claim still exists towards the landsbanki receivership who one year earlier had been ordered by the supreme court of iceland to repay the entire amount of confiscated deposit values including minimum deposit guarantees as priority claims which totaled isk 852bn 446bn 503bn to the uk financial services compensation scheme and isk 282bn 167bn to de nederlandsche bank as of 12 september 2013 the landsbanki receivership had through liquidation of the first half of its assets managed to repay the first 539 isk 715bn 423bn of all the priority claims and expected the remaining part would be fully repaid by the end of 2017 the claims for accrued interests after 22 april 2009 related to the delayed repayment of priority claims will however only be treated as secondary general claims and the estimated value of the receiverships liquidated assets will not be sufficient to meet these additional claims in full
